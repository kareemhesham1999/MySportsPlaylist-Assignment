# Business Understanding answers

## Why a Playlist feature improves the Clubber TV user experience?

- This feature transforms the platform from a passive viewing experience into an interactive one where users can organize content according to their preferences, increasing engagement and retention.

- Additionally, by saving matches for later viewing, users can better manage their time and never miss important games, even when they can't watch them live, which is particularly valuable in the sports streaming domain where content relevance is often time-sensitive.

- A Playlist lets users bookmark matches they care about, so they can easily find and watch them later without searching. It turns passive browsing into a personalized, interactive experience, boosting engagement. By saving games for later, users never miss key moments—even when they can’t watch live.

## Feature Suggestion

As a football fan, I’d love timely **push alerts** for key moments—goals, red cards, and match start/end—so I never miss the action. After each game, a concise **post‑match summary** highlighting goals, standout players, and key statistics would keep me up to date on my favorite teams’ performances.

Beyond live streaming, a real‑time **match dashboard**—showing possession, shots on goal, player heatmaps, and upcoming set pieces—would let me dive deeper into the action without ever leaving the video.
